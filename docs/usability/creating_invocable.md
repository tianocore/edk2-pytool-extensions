# Creating An Invocable

Whether you spell it invokable or invocable, the idea of an Invocable is central to Stuart.
If you're unfamiliar with what it is, refer to the using guid in the root docs folder.
In a nutshell, an invokable is a small python file that gets the project Mu environment setup for it.
It gets a settings file (that the invocable defines the interface for) that provides information about the that we are being invoked on.
