# Tianocore Edk2 PyTool Extensions (edk2toolext)

This is a Tianocore maintained project consisting of command line and other python tools and extensions for building and maintaining an Edk2 based UEFI firmware code tree.  This package's intent is to provide tools, scripts, and a plugin based environment for use within the tools and scripts.  This environment has command line interfaces to support building a product, building CI, running tests, and downloading dependencies.  This environment also provides the building blocks for developers to write their own tools to launch in the environment and leverage the capabilities provided by the environment.  The unique capabilities provided help support building products with multiple repositories and having each repository contribute/plugin to the build process in a scalable way.  The environment will scan the files in the code tree (multiple repos) and discover plugins, dependencies, path adjustments, environment variable settings, etc.  This provides easy methods for common repositories to share build tools/steps.

Inclusion of this package is best managed using Pip/Pypi.  This package makes use of edk2-pytool-library.

This is a supplemental package and is not required to be used for edk2 builds.

## Content

The package contains cli tools and a basic common environment for running tools.  This common environment supports extensions, subclassing, and plugin to allow great flexibility for building and maintaining a code tree.

Examples:

* CI build support with plugin
* Binary dependency resolution (nuget, urls, git repos)
* Loggers (markdown, file, memory, and colored console)
* Plugins (pre/post build, function injection)
* Wrapper around edk2 build
* VarDict and ShellEnvrionment to manage key/value pairs consistantly across entire process
* Nuget Publishing tool to push new packages
* Omnicache - Support a super cache of git repos to speed up creating and updating multiple work spaces and minimizing filesystem impact

## Usage

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that you use python virtual environments.  Virtual environments avoid changing the global python workspace and causing conflicting dependencies.  Virtual environments are lightweight and easy to use.  [Learn more](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

* To install run `pip install --upgrade edk2-pytool-extensions`
* To use in your python code

    ```python
    from edk2toolext.<module> import <class>
    ```
